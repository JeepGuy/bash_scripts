sed Printing Selected lines.

p command - pint lines of a file

-n option is used to suppress the default printing of all the lines
      > almost always used with the P command.

To print all lines of the file - use without an address line.

    sed 'p' data.txt

HOWEVER the above command will print all lines twice.

ADDRESS
  > with the address added the matching address will be printed twice.

   sed 2,4' data.txt
    will print lines 2,3 and 4 twice.

This happens because sed automatically prints all lines in the data stream.
 Therefore the p command prints the selected lines AND the sed command
 automatically prints all the lines of the stream.

To suppress the automatic printing of all lines in the stream use the -n option.

sed -n 2,4' data.txt
 will print ONLY lines 2,3 and 4.

PATTERN
----------

sed -n '/Linux/p' data.txt

  > will only print those lines containing the string Linux

Can use negation operator:

sed -n '/Linux/!p' data.txt

  > will only print those lines the do NOT contain the string Linux

  Print Last l;ine of the file"
  use $

      sed -n '$p' data.txt
        > will only print the last line of the file.


MULTIPLE Lines

sed -n 2,4p
>6,8p
>12,$p' data.txt
  Will print 2,3,4  and 6,7,8 and 12 through the end of the file.
