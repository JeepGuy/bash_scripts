sed Print Line Numbers
======================

equal sign used to print line number = This will print the line number before
the actual line is printed.

sed '=' data.txt

You can specify a line number using line number or context addressing.
> Can be useful if yo want to find the line number upon which a particular pattern occurs


Specifying an address:

e.g.  sed '2,6=' data.txt
  > will print the line numbers before line 2 - 6.

Context Addressing
-------------------
  To find the line number on which the name "llinux" occurs you can use context addressing.

e.g. sed '/Linux/=' data1.txt

Will print the line numbers only in front of those lines that have the pattern (context address)
Linux.

Using the -n option will suppress the printing of all the lines except the numbers
by adding the -n option.

e.g. sed -n '/Linux/=' data1.txt

Print only the lines that match the pattern with the preceeding number add the
-p command.

e.g. sed -n '/Linux/{=; p}' data1.txt

Can use the equal command to find the total number of lines in the file.
 > use tne $ because it displays the number of the last line in the file.

e.g. sed -n '$=' data1.txt
