 SED is actually  filter and can be used in a chain of commands.

 if you want to save the results of your filter you must output the results to
 a file or use the redirection operator


    >> temp.file.name

  Or can use the -i option for in place editing the input of the command (pipe)
      * Known as the redirection operator.

    e.g.:   sed -i `s/text1/text2/'  data.text'`  The changes will be made in the file itself.
