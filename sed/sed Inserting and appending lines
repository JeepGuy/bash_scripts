sed Inserting and appending lines
==================================
a command = append lines in the data stream  AFTER the line

i command = insert lines in the data stream  BEFORE the line

  > important note: Not entered on a single command line.

APPEND
-------
sed '[address]a\'
> (command prompt comes up.)
> new line' file_name

sed '4a\'
> This is a new line' data.text

INSERT
------
sed '[address]i\'
> (command prompt comes up.)
> new line' file_name

sed '4i\'
> This is a new line' data.text


MULTIPLE LINES
----------------
add a new line with a backslash after each line
  > until you don;t want to add any more lines.

  sed '4a\'    (or use the i operator)
  > This is a new line 1'\
  > This is a new line 2'\
  > This is a new line 3'\ data.text


ADD AFTER  THE LAST LINE
-------------------------------
  $ use the last line operator.

  sed '$a\'
  > This is a new line' data.text

ADD BEFORE the FIRST LINE
--------------------------
  1i   = line 1 with i operator.

  sed '1i\'      (this is number 1 not L)
  > This is a new line' data.text


  PATTERN

  The new lies will be added before or after the pattern
  ------------------------------------------------------
    > if you do not use a pattern that the lines will be added before or after
      each line.
        - can use to add blank lines in between each line.


e.g.  BEFORE

sed '/London/i\
> This is a new line\
> this is a second new line'  data.txt

e.g.  AFTER

sed '/London/a\
> This is a new line\
> this is a second new line'  data.txt

For all lines
------------
> if you do not use a pattern that the lines will be added before or after
  each line.
    - can use to add blank lines in between each line.
