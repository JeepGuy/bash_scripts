SED Substituting text
======================
presented by a single s
- must put n single quotes so BASH doesn't interpret it as a bash command.

sed 'sed/searchPattern/replacementText/flags'  file

e.g. sed 's/Delhi/Bangalore/'  data.txt
  - This will replace the FIRST INSTANCE of the word Delhi with Bangalore in each
     line of the file data.txt to stdout
  - - To change a file you must direct this out to a tmp file and then rename it.
  e.g. sed 's/Delhi/Bangalore/'  data.txt > file.txt
  - - "-i" option = To replace the line of text in the data.txt you must use the -i option.

Adding a number will replace only that occurrence of the string in the line.
e.g. sed  's/Delhi/Bangalore/3'  data.txt
   - This will replace only the third occurrence of the word Delhi in each line.
   the numeral 3 is a flag

"g" flag = global
  - Will replace ALL occurrences of a specific string (word) = add the flag "g"
e.g. sed  's/Delhi/Bangalore/g'  data.txt


"p" flag = print
  - will print all the lines in which the replacement has been done.
e.g. sed  's/Delhi/Bangalore/p'
   * must use the - n option to get the correct ouput.


"w" flag = save all the modified lines
   - save all the modified files to a file.
 e.g. sed  's/Delhi/Bangalore/w/<name_of_file_to_save_info>'  data.txt

 e.g. 2 = e.g. sed  's/Delhi/Bangalore/w file2.txt'   data.txt  > file3.txt
   - will save the modified output to file2.txt and then all of the modified
     output to file3.txt = a new file with all content including the changed lines.

 "empty" flag = delete
  - Delete the matched expression
e.g. sed  's/Delhi//g file' data.txt
  - - will replace all the occurrences of "Delhi" with nothing

ALL ABOVE was input from a file.

Now take the input from another command.
----------------------------------------
 - pipe the preceeding command into the sed command.
e.g. sort data1.txt | sed 's/Delhi/Bangalore/'


Can be used as a filter in the middle of a string of commands
sort data1.txt | sed 's/Delhi/Bangalore/' | head -3  (head cmd to get only 3 lines)
