sed_line_addressing_context_addressing
======================================
  -  providing and address before the sed command.

 sed options [address] commands file(s)

   - when no address is specified in a sed command, that command (filter) is applied to
     all lines of input data.
   - - To apply the command to only a few lines of the input, specify an address
       one of two ways:
        1. Line addressing
        2. Context addressing

Line Addressing:
=================

Provide the exact line number or a comma separated range of numbers.

sed 's/str1/str2/' data.txt  ADD the line number as in:

  sed '4s/str1/str2/' data.txt

For a range of lines:  add a comma and the ending line.
---------------------
 sed '4,8s/str1/str2/' data.txt
  - This will apply the command to lines 4 through 8

For the Last line of the file:  (use a $)
------------------------------
  sed '$s/str1/str2/' data.txt
  - applies the cmd to the last line in a file
Range to end of file: add  line_num,$
---------------------
  sed '4,$s/str1/str2/' data.txt
  - applies the command to the 4th line through the end of the file.

Context Addressing:
===================
  - specify a single pattern or a comma separated set of patterns to select the patterns
    on which the pattern is to be applied.
  - The pattern is enclosed within two patterns
    - - can be simple text or regular expressions.

    e.g.  sed '/pattern/s/str1/str2/' data.txt
        > The s command will be applied to only those lines that match the expression

Range of lines:
---------------
    The following example will apply the command to the first occurrence of a line
      that begins with pattern1 through to the line that contains pattern2.
       > all lines between the two patterns

      e.g.    sed '/pattern1/,/pattern2/s/str1/str2/' data.txt

 COMBINING Line addressing and Context addressing:
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Line number to pattern:
  e.g.    sed '3,/pattern2/s/str1/str2/' data.txt
        > Apply s command beginning at line 3 through to the line that matches
          the line that contains pattern2

Pattern to a line number:

  e.g.    sed '/pattern2/,9s/str1/str2/' data.txt
          > from the first occurence of patter2 through to line number 9

The + operator (Plus):
   > Applies the command to the matched pattern plus the number of lines specified
    after the plus sign.

  e.g.    sed '/pattern2/+9s/str1/str2/' data.txt

          This would apply the command to the first line that matched pattern2
          and 9 additional lines.
