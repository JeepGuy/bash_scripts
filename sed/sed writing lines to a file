sed Writing to another file
---------------------------

sed ''/w newfile.txt' data.txt

This will write all the lines from data.txt to newfile.txt.

Line Addressing
---------------

sed '2,6w newfile.txt' data.txt

  > only the lines from 2 through 6 will be written to the new file.
  - can use the -n option to suppres output.
  > if the newfile.txt does not exist sed will create it.
  > if the newfile.txt exists, sed will over write it.
  - can specify the newfile.txt location by absolute or relative path.
  > user who uses this command must have write permissions on the newfile.txt file.

Context addressing
-------------------
> write selective lines to the file.

sed '/Bangalore/w fileB.txt'  students.txt

> all lines that contain Bangalore will be written to the fileB.txt


Multiple files
--------------

sed -n '/Unix/w file1.txt
> /Linux/w file2.txt
> /Windows/w file3.txt'  data.txt

All lines containing Unix will be written to file.txt
All lines containing Linux will be written to file.txt
All lines containing Windows will be written to file.txt


Negation operator
-----------------

sed -n '/Windows/w file1.txt
> /Windows/!w file2.txt'  data.txt

Split a big file into pieces
-----------------------------

sed -n '1,5w dataA
> 6.10w dataB
> 11,$w dataC'  data.txt

-- this will be split into three files, 1-5, 5 - 10 and 11 through the end of
the last line.
