SED Deleting Lines
=======================
 The d or delete command is used to delete specific lines of text
 from the data stream (input.)
  > no changes are made to the file  just he input stream.
  .. must save changes to a temp file and then renamed.
   OR used the re-direction operator.
   >>  the -i option for in place editing the input of the command (pipe)
       * Known as the redirection operator.
     e.g.:   sed -i `s/text1/text2/'  data.text'`  The changes will be made in the file itself.

 If there is no address in the command then the delete command is applied to
 all lines in the command.

e.g. sed 'd' data.txt
 > not very useful.

sed '5d' data.txt
 > will delete only the fifth line in the stream (input)

sed '3,7d' data.txt
 > will delete all lines from number three through 7 in the data.txt stream
  include line 7

Context addressing
---------------------

sed '/pattern/d' data.txt
 > Will delete all lines that contain the pattern


DELETE EMPTY LINES
------------------
Use the two anchoring characters    ^ for beginning of stream
                                    $ for last line

sed '/^$/d' fileA.txt
  > will not delete lines that have a space, tab or a carriage return.

DELETE ALL BLANK LINES
-----------------------
pattern to match all spaces, tabs, ~ empty lines.
 >   /^[\t]*$

 e.g. sed '/^[\t]*$' fileA.txt
  > matches all occurrences of spaces, tabs and also matches empty lines.

  Text patterns
  -------------
Matches all patterns that match the text and delete.

RANGE:
e.g. sed '/Oliver/,/Smith/d'  empdata.txt
 > deletes all lines between Oliver and Smith.
  - if the second pattern is not present that all lines until the end are
  deleted.
 - - if there are two occurrences of Oliver then the second occurrence will
      also be matched and deleted until the next occurrence of Smith... Which
      could be to the end of the file.
