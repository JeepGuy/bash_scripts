sed reading from a file
=======================
 r = The read command allows you to read from another file and insert its contents
 into the editor output.

 e.g. sed '5r file1' empdata
  > This command will insert the contents of file1 AFTER line 5 of empdata
    into empdata.

To insert after teh last line use the $
   e.g. sed '$r file1' empdata


Patterns:
---------
 insert after a line that contains a pattern - Berlin
'
     e.g. sed '/Berlin/r file1' empdata
        > If there are differnet occurrences of the pattern... the contents
          will be inserted after each line that contains the pattern.

REPLACE:
--------
Can use read command along with the delete command

e.g.

sed '/ItemList/{
> r grocery.txt
> d
}' note.txt

> After the line ItemsList in note.txt, the contents of the file grocery.txt will
be inserted and the line ItemsList will be deleted.
