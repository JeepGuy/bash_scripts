Critical info about sudo.
=========================

ssh server01 id
uid=1000(vagrant) gid=1000(vagrant) groups=1000(vagrant)


ssh server01 sudo id
> means we are executing the ssh command as the current user.
> The sudo id command means we are executing the id command as root.

[vagrant@admin01 vagrant]$ ssh server01 sudo id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
> you are connected to the machine as the vagrant user
HOWEVER you are executing the id command as root (sudo)

sudo ssh server01 id
> means we are connecting to server01 as root
and then running the command as the current users - which happens to be the root
user.

the results are the same in this case ...
EXCEPT you have to enter in the root password...
