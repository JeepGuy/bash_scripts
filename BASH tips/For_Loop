For Loops

for VARIABLE_NAME in ITEM_1 ITEM_N
do
command 1
command 2
command N
done

> The first item in the list is assigned to the VARIABLE_NAME and then is executed,
then the next item in the list is assigned to the variable and executed until the end
of the list is reached.

EXAMPLE:

for COLOR in red green blue
do
echo "COLOR: $COLOR"
done

usually have a space separated set of values..

Common to have the list declared as a variable:
------------------------------------------------
EXAMPLE:

COLORS="red green blue"
for COLOR in $COLORS
do
echo "COLOR: $COLOR"
done


CHANGE THE NAME OF A FILE:
--------------------------

#!/bin/bash
PICTURES=$(ls *jpg)
DATE=$(date +%F)
for PICTURE in $PICTURES
do
echo "Renaming ${PICTURE} to ${DATE}-${PICTURE}"
mv ${PICTURE} ${DATE}-${PICTURE}
done


POSITIONAL PARAMETERS
---------------------
- variable that contain the contents of the command line.
 The variables are $0 - $9
 - The script itself is always $0.
 EXAMPLE:

 $ script.sh parameter1 parameter2 parameter3
$0 : "script.sh"
$1 : "parameter1"
$2 : "parameter2"
$3 : "parameter

$@ : accesses all the variables $1 - $9 - this way you can enter in multiple values
on the command line and the for loop will access each variable in order.

Instead of referring to $1 throughout the script you should create a new variable
the refer to that piece of data.

NEW_VARIABLE_NAME=$1
