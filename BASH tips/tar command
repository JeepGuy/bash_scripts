tar command   - tape archive (original meaning)
===========

tar and gzip
============

Create
======
Compress an Entire Directory or a Single File
Use the following command to compress an entire directory or a single file on Linux.
It’ll also compress every other directory inside a directory you specify–in other words, it works recursively.

tar-zcvf <name of file>  /path/to/files-to-add
aka
tar -czvf name-of-archive.tar.gz /path/to/directory-or-file

    -c, --create   - create a new archive
    -v verbose
    -z: Compress the archive with gzip.
    -v: Display progress in the terminal while creating the archive, also known as “verbose” mode. The v is always optional in these commands, but it’s helpful.
    -f: Allows you to specify the filename of the archive > -f give a filename arg.


EXTRACT
=======

tar -zxvf rebol.tar.gz
 > add -z for a zipped or compressed file.

- Automatically removes the preceeding / so when you extract it it won't override the existing directory.


un tar a file to a different directory
======================================

To extract an archive to a directory different from the current,
use the -C, or --directory, tar option, as in

    tar -xf archive.tar -C /target/directory

*** Note that the target directory has to exist before running that command
    (it can be created by mkdir /target/directory).
To simply extract the contents and create target directory if it is missing:

  mkdir -p /target/directory && tar xf archive.tar -C /target/directory

To extract and also remove the root(first level) directory in the zip

  mkdir -p /target/directory && tar xf archive.tar -C /target/directory --strip-components=1
