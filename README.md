Helpful Bash Scripts

Various helpful bash scripts and notes.
  - created from the Advanced BASH Scripting Course authored by Jason Cannon at LinuxTrainingAcademy.com and The Linux Bootcamp by Dr. Deepli Skalvaski on Udemy.com

Some of these scripts are modifications of sample scripts provided by the instructors and some are authored by myself. I will attempt to give attribution where possible.
