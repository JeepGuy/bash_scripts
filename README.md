Helpful Bash Scripts

These are various helpful bash scripts that were created using the BASH Scripting Course created and taught by Jason Cannon on Udemy.com.

Some of these scripts were initially authoried by jason Cannon and some have been authored by myself as I took the course or as needed.

Some of these scripts are modifications of sample scripts provided by Jason Cannon or others.
