Running awk commands from a file
=================================

Just like sed...

Use the " -f" instruction to
store commands in a file and run them by calling the file
 > to distinguish this file from other files you can give it the
   extension .awk
EXAMPLE:
--------

cat file1.awk
{
$2=$2+5
$3=$3=10
print $0
}
TO RUN:

awk -f file1.awk students.txt

This will apply the commands in the saved file to each line of the students.txt file.

EXAMPLE 2
---------

cat file2.awk
/London/{print}
/Berlin/{print}

THE PRINT statement is not required because {print} is the default action of awk.
THEREFORE: In the file
cat file2A.awk
/London/{print}
/Berlin/

Line 1 is will have the same output as line 2

awk -f file2.awk teachers.txt
 > will only print the lines that have either London or Berlin in them.
 AND if you used file2A.awk = SAME OUTPUT.

 CAN also have multiple commands per line:

cat file3.awk

 /London/{$3=$3+100; print}
 /Berlin/{$3=$3+200; print}

 is a valid awk set of operations...

TO PRINT ALL THE LINES: move the print statement to the last line of the file
and remove it from the multiple command section in the awk statment
 - - - This is because there is no selecton criteria for the print command.

/London/{$3=$3+100}
/Berlin/{$3=$3+200}
{print}
