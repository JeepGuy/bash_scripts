awk Multiple Commands
=====================
Write multiple commands in the curly braces {} seperated by a semi-colon ;

awk '{$3=$3+400; print $0}' teachers.txt
 > the semi-colon is between the two seperate commands.
  - first 400 is added to the the third field
  - print $0 = print the entire line.
  * since there is no selection criteria all the lines are printed.

Used with selection criteria
=============================

awk '/London/{$3=$3+400; print $0}' teachers.txt
  > Now the selection criteria London is added therefore the following commands
    will only be applied to those lines that contain the word London.
    AND the entire line is displayed.



To print all the lines but only select some lines for modification then separate
the commands with curly braces {}

awk '{$3=$3+400} {print $0}' teachers.txt

SPLIT the awk command across lines (cr)
----------------------------------------

awk '/London/{$3=$3+400}
>  {print $0}' teachers.txt

EXAMPLE 2
---------

awk '/London/{$3=$3+400
> /Delhi/{$2="Bangalore"; $#=$3+300}
> ; print $0}' teachers.txt

This will add 400 to the third field IF London is in the line,
and Change Delhi to Bangalore if the line contains Delhi,
and adds 300 to the 2nd field if the line contains Delhi
and then it prints all the lines.
