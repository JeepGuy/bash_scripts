AWK Field Delimiter
====================

AWK by default uses a space or spaces as a field delimiter.

To specify a different character as a field delimiter use the
 " - F " option

 awk -F'|' '{print $2}' data.txt

  This will split the input on the pipe character.
  - you can use this with any single character as an input field delimiter.

  ---

etc/passwd uses the colon as a field separator.
 > therefore you can split the text by the colon.

tail is the linux command to output the last part of files given to is via standard input.

tail -5 /etc/passwd | awk -F':' '{print $1, $NF}'
Stdout:
postfix /sbin/nologin
sshd /sbin/nologin
tcpdump /sbin/nologin
jcbrent /bin/bash
dockerroot /sbin/nologin
