AWK
===

- a text processing tool - similar to sed but much more powerful.
> Used for generating formatted reports by extracting fields from large files
It is a full programming language that includes all the constructs of a programming
language such as:
 Operators, variables, if else statements,
 > Resembles the constructs of the C Progamming language.
 Named after the initial letters of its creators names:
 Aho
 Weinberger
 Kernighan


Basic construct:

$awk options 'selection_criteria {command}'  files(s)

Like sed it can take its input from a file or more than one file.
 > If no file input is provided it takes its standard input from the command line.
 - Can be used on the right side of a pipe |
   THEREFORE, act on an output of a command.

   AWK commands are generally preceeded by a selection criteria.

   Selection criteria can be a pattern which is a simple selection string or
   it can have regular expressions like that which is in grep.
   > Like the addressing part of sed but much more advanced.
      - can use variables, operators and other programming statements.
      - can select line based on the trim (?) conditions.
      - command should be enclosed in curly braces {}
How it works:
like sed - it reads one line of the input stream at a time and applies the commands on it.
- It does not make any changes to the input file.
   -- it just processes the data and outputs it to stdout.
   - It does not make any changes to the input file.
   - can save the data to another file by using the re-direction operator.
e.g.

  awk '/London/{print}' data.txt

  The selection criteria is London, the command is the awk command "print".
   > just prints the text to the stdout.

   Printing is the default action of awk.
    THEREFORE the following stmt is identical to the above stmt.

   awk '/London/{print}' data.txt

PRINT ALL
==========
   To print all lines of the file - don't specify a selection criteria as in:

   awk '{print}' data.txt

   If no command is provided then the print command is assumed.

   Cannot omit both the selection criteria and the command.
so
   awk data.txt doesn't do anything.

REDIRECTION Operator     >
====================
awk '/London/{print}' data.txt > newFile.txt

To change the original file you can re-name the newFile.txt to data.txt after
the operation is performed.
